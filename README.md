Game Objective: Score higher and better.

- Please note::
- Hitting the boundaries reduces health/life points!
- Slimes randomly increase in speed and when they get too fast they evaporate.
- You, as a slime, can combat by running into another slime.
- Combat with another slime decreases your health/life points.
- Combat with another slime increases your Combat Score.
- Health slowly increases back up.
- Slimes randomly generate over time.
- The main goal is to find a balance between combat vs. dodge.
    ... before there are just too many slimes! XD

Good luck!
